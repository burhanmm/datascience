    "# Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method is a feature selection technique that selects the most relevant features based on their statistical properties, such as correlation with the target variable or variance. It works by evaluating each feature independently of the others and ranking them according to a pre-defined criterion. The most common metrics used in the Filter method are the chi-squared test, correlation coefficient, mutual information, and ANOVA F-test."

    "# Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wrapper method is a feature selection technique that selects the most relevant features by evaluating the performance of a machine learning model with different subsets of features. Unlike the Filter method, the Wrapper method considers the interdependence between features and how they affect the predictive power of the model. The Wrapper method uses a search algorithm to find the best subset of features that maximizes the model's performance on a validation set."

    "# Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
    "Embedded feature selection methods are techniques that combine feature selection with model training. The most common Embedded methods are Lasso and Ridge regression, decision tree-based algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). These methods perform feature selection during model training by penalizing or eliminating irrelevant features."

    "# Q4. What are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    " One of the drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection is that it does not consider the interaction between features. A feature that has a low correlation with the target variable may still be relevant if it interacts with other features in the model. Moreover, the Filter method does not guarantee the optimal subset of features, and it may miss relevant features that are not highly correlated with the target variable."

    "The Filter method is preferred over the Wrapper method when the dataset has a large number of features and the computational cost of evaluating different subsets of features is prohibitively high. The Filter method is also preferred when the features are independent of each other and do not interact significantly."
