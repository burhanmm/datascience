    "# Q1- Explain the following with an example:\n",
    "a) Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "b) Machine Learning\n",
    "c) Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, and learning from experience. AI systems can be either rule-based, where they follow explicit programming rules, or machine learning-based, where they learn patterns and make predictions based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a chatbot that can have a conversation with a person and provide relevant responses is an example of an AI system. The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand what the person is saying and generate appropriate responses. It can learn from past interactions to improve its responses over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training computer algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data. ML algorithms are trained on a dataset, and they learn to recognize patterns and make predictions based on that data. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an image recognition system that can identify objects in pictures is an example of an ML system. The system is trained on a dataset of images, with each image labeled as containing a specific object. The algorithm learns to recognize the features of that object and can then identify it in new images.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn and make predictions based on large amounts of data. Deep learning models are made up of layers of interconnected nodes, with each layer processing information from the previous layer. Deep learning algorithms can automatically learn representations of data, allowing them to perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a self-driving car that can detect objects in its environment is an example of a deep learning system. The car is equipped with cameras and sensors that collect data about its surroundings. The data is then fed into a deep learning algorithm that has been trained to recognize objects, such as other cars, pedestrians, and traffic lights. The algorithm can then make decisions about how to navigate the car based on that information.\n"
