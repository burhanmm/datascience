    "\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability of each possible value that a discrete random variable can take. The PMF is defined as follows:\n",

    "P(X = x) = f(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is a discrete random variable and f(x) is the probability of X taking the value x.\n",

    "An example of a PMF could be the number of heads that occur when flipping a coin three times. The PMF would be:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Uniform distribution is a probability distribution in which all possible outcomes have an equal probability of occurring. In other words, the probability of any event or value occurring in a uniform distribution is the same. The uniform distribution is often used in probability theory and statistics, especially in situations where all possible outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a uniform distribution is rolling a fair six-sided die. When we roll a die, we have six possible outcomes, each with an equal probability of 1/6. The probability of rolling a 1 is the same as the probability of rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Thus, we can say that the distribution of outcomes from rolling a fair six-sided die follows a uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of uniform distribution is selecting a random number from a range of values. For instance, suppose we have a jar with 100 balls numbered from 1 to 100, and we randomly select a ball from the jar without looking. In this case, each ball has an equal chance of being selected, and thus the probability of selecting any particular ball is 1/100. This also follows a uniform distribution as each number has an equal probability of being selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform distribution is essential in various fields such as engineering, physics, computer science, and economics. It provides a useful framework for analyzing situations in which there is an equal likelihood of a range of outcomes."

    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics. It states that when independent random variables are added together, the sum tends to follow a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the distribution of the original random variables. This means that if we take repeated random samples of size n from any population, the sampling distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed, with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of n.\n",

    "In other words, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that if we take enough random samples of a population and compute the mean of each sample, the distribution of these means will be normally distributed, even if the original population is not normally distributed. The CLT is a critical concept in statistics because it allows us to make inferences about a population based on a sample. It also provides a framework for hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of the Central Limit Theorem includes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sampling variability: The CLT explains the behavior of sampling variability, which is a key concept in statistical inference. It tells us that as the sample size increases, the sample mean will become more stable and will better represent the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hypothesis testing: The CLT is used to test hypotheses about population means. When the sample size is sufficiently large, the CLT allows us to use the normal distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining a sample mean that is different from the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Confidence intervals: The CLT is used to construct confidence intervals for population means. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the population mean with a certain level of confidence.\n",
