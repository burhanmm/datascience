    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean, also known as the average, is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency and is sensitive to extreme values or outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in order from smallest to largest. It is not affected by extreme values or outliers in the dataset and is therefore useful when dealing with skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is useful for describing the most common value in a dataset and is particularly useful for categorical or nominal data. If there are two values that appear equally frequently, the dataset is bimodal."

    "Mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency used in statistics to describe the typical or central value of a dataset.\n",

    "The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and then dividing the sum by the number of values. The mean is sensitive to extreme values, so if there are any outliers in the dataset, they can greatly affect the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order from lowest to highest. If there is an even number of values, then the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may have multiple modes, or no mode at all if all the values are equally common. The mode is useful for identifying the most common value or values in a dataset.\n",

    "All three measures of central tendency are used to describe the typical or central value of a dataset. The mean is commonly used when the data is normally distributed and has no outliers. The median is used when the data has outliers or when the distribution is not normal. The mode is useful when identifying the most common value or values in a dataset. The choice of which measure to use depends on the characteristics of the dataset and the research question being addressed."

    "The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. While it is a simple measure of dispersion, it can be affected by outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance is a measure of how much the individual data points vary from the mean of the dataset. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean, and then dividing by the number of data points minus one. A larger variance indicates greater variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and it measures the average distance of the data points from the mean. It is a more commonly used measure of dispersion because it is expressed in the same units as the original data and is more interpretable. A larger standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data.\n",

Then, calculate the squared difference between each data point and the mean, sum them up, and divide by 9 (the number of data points minus one): ((120-142.5)^2 + (125-142.5)^2 + ... + (165-142.5)^2) / 9 = 462.5. The variance is 462.5.\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance: sqrt(462.5) = 21.49.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance and correlation are both measures of the relationship between two variables in a dataset, but they differ in terms of their scale and interpretation.\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables vary together. Specifically, it measures the average deviation of one variable from its mean, multiplied by the average deviation of the other variable from its mean. If the covariance is positive, it means that the two variables tend to vary together in the same direction, while a negative covariance means that they tend to vary in opposite directions. However, the magnitude of the covariance depends on the scales of the two variables, so it is difficult to compare covariances across different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized version of covariance, which makes it easier to compare the relationship between two variables across different datasets. Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, and it ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 means that the two variables are perfectly positively correlated (i.e., they vary together in the same direction), while a correlation of -1 means that they are perfectly negatively correlated (i.e., they vary in opposite directions). A correlation of 0 means that there is no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both covariance and correlation are used in statistical analysis to examine the relationship between two variables in a dataset. However, correlation is generally preferred because it provides a more standardized measure of the relationship, which is easier to interpret and compare across different datasets. Covariance is still useful in certain situations, such as when the units of measurement are meaningful or when comparing datasets with the same units."

    "Outliers can have a major impact on the mean (average) since it takes into account every value in the data set. If an outlier is much higher or lower than the other values, the mean will be shifted in the direction of the outlier. However, the median and mode are not affected by outliers since they are based on the order or frequency of the data rather than the actual values.\n",
    "Example: Consider a data set of salaries of employees in a company, with salaries ranging from 30,000 to 150,000. However, there is one employee with a salary of 1,000,000. In this case, the mean salary will be much higher than the typical salary of the employees. The median and mode, on the other hand, will not be affected by this outlier, since they are not influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "Outliers can also affect measures of dispersion, such as the range and standard deviation. The range (difference between the largest and smallest values) will be greatly influenced by the outlier. The standard deviation, which measures the spread of the data around the mean, will also be affected by outliers. Outliers can increase or decrease the standard deviation depending on the direction of the outlier.\n",
