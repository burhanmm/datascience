    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a software application that allows you to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. It is a structured way of organizing data so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases can be used for a wide range of applications, such as managing customer information, storing financial data, or tracking inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables. They use SQL as their query language to interact with the data. SQL databases are structured, and all data is organized into tables with predefined columns and rows. They enforce strict data integrity rules and provide support for complex joins and transactions. SQL databases are best suited for applications that require complex querying and analysis of structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of formats, such as key-value, document, graph, or columnar. They do not use SQL as their query language, and the data is not structured in tables. Instead, NoSQL databases use APIs to interact with the data. NoSQL databases are highly scalable, flexible, and can handle large volumes of unstructured data. They are best suited for applications that require high scalability and fast data retrieval, such as big data and real-time analytics."

    "\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL is used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL statements are used to define the schema or structure of the database and are typically executed by database administrators or developers. Some common DDL commands include CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, CREATE INDEX, ALTER INDEX, and DROP INDEX.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using DDL statements, developers can define the data types, constraints, and relationships between tables in the database. DDL helps to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the data and can improve the performance of the database by optimizing the structurea of the tables."

    "### 2. DROP:The DROP command is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. For example, the following SQL statement drops the \"customers\" table that we created earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object such as adding or dropping columns, changing data types, or modifying constraints. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called \"phone\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all rows from a table while keeping its structure intact. For example, the following SQL statement removes all rows from the \"customers\" table:\n",

    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n"

    "A primary key is a unique identifier for a record or row in a table that helps to distinguish it from other records. It is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Primary keys ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data by preventing duplicate records from being created in the table. Primary keys can be used to link multiple tables together and create relationships between them. Each table can have only one primary key, and it cannot contain null or duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It creates a relationship between two tables and ensures the integrity of the data. It allows data to be shared between tables, and it can be used to retrieve data from multiple tables using a single query. The foreign key column in one table must match the primary key column in the other table. Foreign keys can be used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that the data in the related tables is consistent and accurate. A table can have multiple foreign keys, and they can contain null or duplicate values."
