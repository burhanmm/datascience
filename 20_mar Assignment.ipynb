    "# Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another. In data science, encoding is useful because many machine learning algorithms require numerical input data. Encoding allows us to convert categorical data into a numerical format that can be used for analysis and modeling."

    "# Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, is a technique for converting categorical variables into numerical variables by assigning each unique category a numerical value. For example, in a dataset of different car models, we might assign a numerical value to each car brand (e.g., Toyota=1, Honda=2, Ford=3, etc.). Nominal encoding is useful when the categories have a natural ordering, but the actual numerical values assigned are arbitrary."

For example, in a dataset of different levels of education, we might assign a numerical value to each level (e.g., High School=1, Bachelor's=2, Master's=3, etc.). One-hot encoding is preferred when the categories do not have a natural ordering, and each category is equally important."

The reason for this is that the categories do not have a natural ordering, and each category is equally important.

You have a dataset with 5 features, including the customer's gender, age, contract type,monthly charges, and tenure. Which encoding technique(s) would you use to transform the categoricaldata into numerical data? Provide a step-by-step explanation of how you would implement the encoding.\n",

    "To transform the categorical data in the customer churn dataset into numerical data, I would use the following encoding techniques:\n",

    "Age: Age is already a numerical feature, so no encoding is necessary.\n",

    "Contract Type: Contract type has three categories (month-to-month, one-year, and two-year), so I would use one-hot encoding to create binary columns for each category. For example, I would create three new columns: one for month-to-month, one for one-year, and one for two-year. If a customer has a month-to-month contract, the value in the corresponding column would be 1, and the values in the other columns would be 0. If a customer has a one-year or two-year contract, the value in the corresponding column would be 1, and the values in the other columns would be 0.\n",
