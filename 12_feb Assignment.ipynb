    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of program execution. When an exception occurs, Python raises an error message to alert the programmer about the problem. Exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as division by zero, attempting to access an undefined variable, or attempting to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter is unable to parse a program's code due to incorrect syntax. A syntax error is a mistake in the way the code is written that prevents it from being parsed correctly, and it is usually detected by the interpreter during the program's compilation phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are detected during the program's compilation phase. Another difference is that exceptions can be caught and handled by the program, while syntax errors must be fixed by the programmer before the program can be executed. In other words, syntax errors are a result of the programmer's mistakes, while exceptions can be caused by a wide range of factors, including user input or system errors."
