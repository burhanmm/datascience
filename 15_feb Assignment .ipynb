    "Multiprocessing in Python allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously on a multicore CPU, which can speed up the execution of certain tasks by using multiple CPUs or cores. It is useful for tasks that can be divided into smaller, independent subtasks, such as data processing or analysis, and provides benefits such as increased performance, reliability, fault tolerance, and resource utilization."

    "A multiprocessing pool in Python is a set of worker processes that are created and managed by the multiprocessing module. The pool allows you to perform a set of tasks concurrently by distributing them among the worker processes in the pool.\n",

    "The multiprocessing module provides the Pool class, which is used to create a pool of worker processes. Once the pool is created, you can submit tasks to it using the apply, apply_async, map, and map_async methods. These methods distribute the tasks among the worker processes in the pool, and return the results when the tasks are completed.\n",
