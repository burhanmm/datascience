    "A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors that an object of that class will have. A class acts as a blueprint for creating objects, and objects are instances of a class. For example, you might have a class \"Student_Record\" that describes the properties and behaviors of people in general, such as name, age, address, and the courses they are enrolled.\n",

    "An object, on the other hand, is a specific instance of a class. It is an individual entity that has its own attributes and behaviors defined by the class.

    "Abstraction: This refers to the ability of an object to hide its internal complexity and provide a simple and intuitive interface to the outside world. It allows the programmer to focus on the object's behavior and ignore the details of its implementation.\n",

The values of the name, age, address and course attributes are then printed for each object.\n",
